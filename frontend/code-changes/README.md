## How to Use

1. Copy the files from this folder to your existing project, maintaining the same directory structure
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies (React, Lucide React icons, etc.)
3. Import and use the components as needed

## Dependencies Required

Make sure your project has these dependencies:
- `react` and `react-dom`
- `lucide-react` for icons
- `@radix-ui/*` components (for UI components)
- `tailwindcss` for styling
- `class-variance-authority` and `clsx` for styling utilities

## Notes

- All components use semantic design tokens defined in `index.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`
- The calendar widget now supports both condensed (8-hour blocks) and detailed (24-hour) views
- Task interface has been extended to include time property for hourly scheduling
